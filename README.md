# 📝 Text Classifier - NLP Project

A simple yet powerful Python-based application that automatically classifies text sentences into Sports, Tech, or Politics.
This project demonstrates the practical use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning using the Naive Bayes algorithm.

## 🚀 Project Overview
In today’s digital world, large amounts of text data are generated every second—news articles, social media posts, blogs, and more. Manually sorting this data is inefficient and time-consuming.

This project solves that problem by teaching a machine how to understand and categorize text based on patterns in words.
Using a set of labeled sentences, the model learns which words are commonly associated with each category and then predicts the category of new, unseen text.

This project was developed as part of my final year BCA technical portfolio to showcase practical machine learning skills.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
--Programming Language: Python 3.x

--NLP Library: NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)

--Machine Learning Algorithm: Naive Bayes Classifier

## 📋 Key Features
Text Cleaning
-Removes unnecessary words (such as the, is, at) to improve accuracy.

Tokenization
-Splits sentences into individual words so the model can analyze them effectively.

Machine Learning Classification
-Uses the Naive Bayes algorithm to make fast and reliable predictions.

Real-Time Prediction
-Users can input custom sentences and instantly see the predicted category.
