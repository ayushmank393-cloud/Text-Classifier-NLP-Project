📝 Text Classifier – NLP Project

A simple yet powerful Python-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) application that automatically classifies text sentences into Sports, Technology, or Politics categories.
This project demonstrates the practical use of Machine Learning and Naive Bayes classification using the NLTK library.

🚀 Project Overview

In today’s digital world, massive amounts of text data are generated every second through news articles, social media posts, blogs, and online platforms.
Manually organizing and categorizing this data is inefficient and time-consuming.

This project addresses that challenge by training a machine learning model to understand text patterns and classify sentences automatically.
Using a labeled dataset, the model learns which words are most commonly associated with each category and predicts the category of new, unseen input text.

This project was developed as part of my final-year BCA technical portfolio to demonstrate practical skills in NLP and Machine Learning.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python 3.x

NLP Library: NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)

Machine Learning Algorithm: Naive Bayes Classifier

📋 Key Features
🔹 Text Cleaning

Removes unnecessary words (such as the, is, at) to improve model accuracy.

🔹 Tokenization

Splits sentences into individual words so the model can analyze them effectively.

🔹 Machine Learning Classification

Uses the Naive Bayes algorithm for fast and reliable text classification.

🔹 Real-Time Prediction

Allows users to enter custom sentences and instantly receive the predicted category.
