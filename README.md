# 📝 Text Classifier - NLP Project

A lightweight and efficient Python tool that classifies text sentences into three categories: **Sports, Tech, or Politics**. This project uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** fundamentals and the **Naive Bayes** algorithm.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to demonstrate how machine learning can categorize text based on word frequency and probability. It is built as part of my final year BCA technical portfolio.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Library:** NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- **Algorithm:** Naive Bayes Classifier

## 📋 Key Features
- **Data Cleaning:** Removes stopwords (the, is, at) to focus on meaningful words.
- **Tokenization:** Breaks down sentences into individual words for analysis.
- **Real-time Prediction:** User can input custom sentences for instant classification.
